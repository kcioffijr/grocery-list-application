# Grocery List Application

## Tech Stack
* HTML
* CSS (Grid and Flexbox)
* Javascript
* Webpack 5

## Requirements
* Provide the ability for users to:
   * Add items to the grocery list.
   * Remove items from the grocery list.
   * Clear all items from the list.
   * Filter / search for items.
* While an end-user is using the application, the application will:
   * Save items to local storage.
   * Only display the clear all button if there are items in the grocery list.
   * Display the filter / search bar if there are 10 or more items in the list.

## Struggles
* Went into the project looking to develop via TDD to later realize that I did not know enough about CommonJS and ES6 modules.
   * This became a struggle attempted to be paired with object oriented design practices.
   * Decided to drop using OOP and TDD for this project with the intention to implement in a future project.
* Knew close to nothing about webpack prior to designing the project and it's requirements.
